🍗 Ingredients for Ayam Geprek:
For the Fried Chicken:
500 grams chicken (thigh or breast, cut into pieces)

2 cloves garlic (mashed or finely grated)

1/2 tsp salt

1/4 tsp white pepper

1 egg

100 grams all-purpose flour

3 tbsp cornstarch (optional for extra crispiness)

Cooking oil (for deep frying)

For the Sambal (Spicy Chili Sauce):
6–10 red bird’s eye chilies (adjust to taste)

2 cloves garlic

A pinch of salt

1/2 tsp sugar

2 tbsp hot cooking oil (from frying the chicken)

👨‍🍳 Cooking Instructions:
1. Marinate the Chicken:
Rub the chicken with garlic, salt, and pepper.

Let it rest for 15–30 minutes.

2. Prepare the Breading:
Beat the egg in one bowl.

In a separate bowl, mix flour and cornstarch.

3. Coat and Fry the Chicken:
Dip the marinated chicken into the egg, then coat it well with the flour mixture.

For extra crunch, you can double dip: egg → flour → egg → flour again.

Deep fry the chicken in hot oil until golden brown and crispy.

Remove and drain on paper towels.

4. Make the Sambal:
In a mortar and pestle, grind the chilies, garlic, salt, and sugar until crushed but not too smooth.

Pour hot oil over the sambal to cook and release aroma.

5. Smash the Chicken:
Place the fried chicken on the mortar with sambal.

Lightly smash the chicken using the pestle until it breaks apart and mixes with the sambal.

🥗 Serving Suggestions:
Serve hot with steamed rice, fresh cucumbers, and maybe fried tempeh or tofu on the side.
