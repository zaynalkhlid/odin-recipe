    üìù Ingredients:
For the Wrapper (Crepes):
250 grams all-purpose flour

1 egg

500 ml water or milk

1 tbsp cooking oil or melted butter

1/2 tsp salt

For the Filling:
4 boiled eggs, sliced

150 grams smoked beef or chicken ham, cut into strips

100 grams grated cheese (optional, for cheesy version)

5-6 tbsp mayonnaise

1 tbsp sweetened condensed milk (optional, for creamy sweetness)

A dash of pepper

For Coating and Frying:
1 egg, beaten (for egg wash)

Breadcrumbs

Cooking oil for deep frying

üë®‚Äçüç≥ How to Make:
1. Make the Wrapper (Crepe):
In a bowl, mix flour and salt.

Add egg, water (or milk), and oil gradually while whisking until smooth.

Strain the batter if lumpy.

Heat a non-stick pan, pour a thin layer of batter and swirl it around to form a thin crepe.

Cook for about 1 minute on low heat until it sets (no need to flip).

Set aside on a plate and repeat.

2. Prepare the Filling:
Mix mayonnaise, sweetened condensed milk (if using), and pepper.

On each crepe, place a slice of boiled egg, some strips of smoked beef, and a spoonful of mayo mix.

Sprinkle cheese if desired.

3. Fold and Roll:
Fold the sides of the crepe inward, then roll from bottom to top tightly like a spring roll.

Repeat for all wrappers.

4. Coat the Risol:
Dip each rolled risol in beaten egg, then coat with breadcrumbs.

5. Deep Fry:
Heat oil over medium heat.

Fry the risol until golden brown and crispy.

Drain on paper towels.

ü•ó Serving Suggestion:
Serve hot with chili sauce or bottled mayo-chili mix.

Perfect for snacks, gatherings, or lunchbox fillers!
